### Project Overview
This project focuses on creating an Inclusivity and Diversity Dashboard using Power BI to analyze and track key performance indicators (KPIs) related to gender balance and diversity within a telecom organization. The dashboard is designed to help HR teams monitor progress and identify challenges in achieving gender diversity, particularly at the executive level.

### Objectives
##### Visualize key KPIs related to gender diversity and inclusion.
- Analyze trends in hiring, promotions, and turnover across genders.
- Identify root causes behind slow progress in gender balance at the executive level.
- Provide actionable insights to improve diversity and inclusion efforts.
  
### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Number of Men vs. Number of Women in the organization.
- Percentage of Women Promoted vs. Percentage of Men Promoted (FY21).
- Hires by Gender: Male vs. female hires.
- Turnover Rate by Gender.
- Average Performance Rating: Comparison between men and women.
- Leavers by Gender (Men vs. Women).
### Visualizations in Power BI
- Bar Charts: Visualize gender distribution in promotions, hires, and turnover rates.
- Pie Charts: Show overall gender ratio in the organization.
- Donut Charts: Present gender breakdown in key metrics, such as promotions or hires, with an aesthetic ring shape.
